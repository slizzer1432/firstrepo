Images and Containers
===========================
A Docker image is a combination of bin/libs that are necessary
for a s/w application to work.Initially all the s/w's of docker 
are available in the form of docker images

A running instance of an image is called as a container


Docker Host: The server where docker is installed is called
               docker host


==========================================================================
Docker Client:This is the CLI of docker where the user can execute the
docker commands,The docker client accepts these commands and passes them
to a background process called "docker deamon"

Docker deamon: This process accepts the commands coming from the docker client
and routes them to work on docker images or containers or the docker registry

Docker registry: This is the cloud site of docker where docker images are
stored.This is of two types
1 Public Registry( hub.docker.com)
2 Private Registry(Setup on one of our local servers)
